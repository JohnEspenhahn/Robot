IMPORTANT:
 * Designed and tested for Windows 7/8 systems. May not work on other operating systems
 
 * Drastically different screen resolutions alter the maximum and minimum dimensions 
   of the file opener window. Because of this the script must be targeted towards a 
   certain dimension. Currently the script works best at **1600x900** screen resolution. 
   It should work (but is not tested at) resolutions near that.
