IMPORTANT:
 * Drastically different screen resolutions alter the maximum and minimum dimensions of the file opener window. 
 * Because of this the script must be targeted towards a certain dimension.
 * Currently the script works best at **1600x900** screen resolution. It should work (but is not tested at) resolutions near that.
